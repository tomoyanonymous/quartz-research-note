> The methods used for preparing ZnO NPs screen-printing paste were based and adapted from the literature.[71] First, the vehicle was prepared by dissolving 5 %wt Ethyl Cellulose 300 cP (C6H7O2 (OC2H5)3; CAS: 9004-57-3) from Aldrich on an 80:20 toluene/ethanol solution (C6H5CH3; CAS: 108-88- 3/ C2H6O; CAS: 64-17-5). After complete dissolution, which takes around 12 hours under stirring at 600 rpm, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 g of ZnO nanopowder, <100 nm particle size (CAS: 1314-13-2) from Aldrich were added always in the same amount of vehicle. The solutions should be kept under continuous stirring until their complete dispersion.
